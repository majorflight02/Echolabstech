Please consider the following information:</P><UL><LI>This app targets a maximum universal joint angle of 3-degrees and an overall driveline operating angle (the difference between Angle 1 and Angle 2) no greater than 2-degrees.  If either universal joint angle exceeds the recommended limit, the driveline operating angle will always result in a failing grade.</LI><LI>If the results are within the accepted range, but were flagged as incorrect, it is because the app has detected the engine/trans and rear axle to be at opposing angles rather than complimentary as desired. Due to the narrow limits of this app, the condition may not cause significant vibration. However, angles that are 'equal and opposite' are most desirable.  See diagram at beginning of app for example of appropriate configuration, noting the dashed lines.</LI><LI>Results of "0.0" throughout the driveline are also considered 'out-of-spec' because a slight amount of preload is recommended for proper function of the needle bearings in the universal joint bearing caps.</LI><LI>Correcting out-of-spec angles may require raising or lowering the engine/transmission or rear axle assembly, or rotation of the rear axle assembly.</LI><LI>Remember, this app does not account for compound angles resulting from the horizontal offset of major components in the vehicle, or those that may not be properly squared in the vehicle chassis.  Either of these conditions may result in universal joint angles being greater than indicated, and vibrations may occur.</LI><LI>For additional support or information, please consult your local driveline professional or contact TREMEC Customer Service at 800-401-9866.</LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
