The results are compared to acceptable angle limits for a typical RWD street performance application and will provide a PASS / FAIL response.</P><P>NOTE: This app is not designed to measure compound angles resulting from horizontal offsets (driveline as viewed from above), and may have some limitations based on the specific smartphone used.  Caution must be used when interpreting results.</P><P>If the results provided by this app are within an acceptable range but driveline vibrations are still experienced, it is recommended that you consult a driveline professional for a thorough inspection.</P></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
