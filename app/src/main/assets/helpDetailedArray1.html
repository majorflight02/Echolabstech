Either of these conditions may result in universal joint angles being greater than indicated, and vibrations may still occur.</LI><LI>This app targets a maximum universal joint angle of 3-degrees and an overall driveline operating angle (the difference between Angle 1 and Angle 2) no greater than 2-degrees.</LI><LI>Driveline angles change with suspension movement and during acceleration/deceleration.  To fine tune your angles, you may want to run the app again with the vehicle loaded and make adjustments as necessary.</LI><LI>For additional support or information, please consult your local driveline professional or contact TREMEC Customer Service at 800-401-9866.</LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
