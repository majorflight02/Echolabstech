Some applications may require removal of driveshaft to record measurement from pinion flange.  Driveshaft-to-flange position should be marked prior to removal in order to maintain original indexing.  Check to ensure that u-joints are properly phased (in line) and in good working order.  Reinstall driveshaft using manufacturer's recommended torque specs.  Failure to do so may result in distortion of bearing caps, resulting in vibration and premature u-joint failure.</P><P>Place your smartphone on a flat surface on the rear axle that is parallel or perpendicular to the pinion <a href='tremec://diagram' style='color:#FFFFFF; '>(see diagram)</a>.
